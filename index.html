    <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
    <p class="rise-on-hover">The World Wide Web (WWW) is today an integral part of everyday life, impacting how we interact, learn, and do business. Often known as the web, its a system of interconnected webpages and information that you can access using the Internet. It helps to find and share information with no problem, making things easier for everyone with everyday use. A web browser is used to access web pages and can be defined as programs that display text, cata, pictures, animation and videos on the Internet. Behind the digital system stands the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a key technology that enables the transfer of data between clients and servers. Even though it is simple in nature, HTTP has experienced several transformations since its inception. HTTP has done so much such as achieving great growth and etc. HTTP was initially created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. His goal was to create a global space of information where documents were connected with hyperlinks. The first implementation, HTTP/0.9, released in 1991, was extremely basic and did nothing more than support transferring raw HTML files via the GET method. It was designed with simplicity in mind to help with the adoption of his other idea, which was the World Wide Web. There were no headers, status codes, just a minimalist request and response model. By 1996, HTTP/1.0 had emerged, which introduced several key improvements. This introduced the capability to have headers, status codes, and multiple methods such as GET, POST, and HEAD in a bid to exercise more control over web communication (GeeksforGeeks). Along with that the introduction of static websites began which are websites that donâ€™t change the content or layout dynamically with revery request to the web server. It displays the exact same information whenever someone visits it, only showing new content only when manually updated. HTTP/1.0 required a new TCP connection per request, which rendered it inefficient for websites with plenty of resources. The release of HTTP/1.1 in 1997 addressed many of these weaknesses by introducing support for persistent connections, employing a single TCP connection for successive requests. It also introduced chunked transfer coding, cache controls, and additional HTTP methods like PUT and DELETE (MDN Web Docs, "Overview of HTTP"). HTTP came to be because it was initially created for HTML pages and simple page displays. It has since been developed to serve media-heavy websites and interactive programs. HTTP came into being in accordance with what the users required and with the increased complexity of websites during the 1990s and early 2000s.    </p>
